# A Bunch Of Random Old Projects by Braden Best

I didn't feel like making a directory for each and every single one of these, especially since most of them are single files, so I bunched up the rest of them into this one mega-repository

I'm pretty sure most of them have their own documentation, but after posting this, I'll be looking through the repo, and filing issues where I see things need clarification, etc.
