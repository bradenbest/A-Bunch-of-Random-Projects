# Framebuffer Random Walk

To configure:
-
Run the following command and follow the instructions

    $ make info

Note that the resolution defaults to 100x100 (I assume there does not exist a device which has a screen smaller than 100x100 pixels). 

So Make sure to do this step unless you want an absurdly small snake game.

-
    $ make

To compile and install:
