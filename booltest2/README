booltest2 by Braden Best

Same as booltest, but I changed to toggle function to use a bitwise operation.

set: index += 2 ^ n

becomes

set: index += 1 << n

Two functions: get and toggle

get: returns (settings >> index) & 1

toggle: adds or subtracts 1 << index from settings based on whether (settings >> index) & 1
